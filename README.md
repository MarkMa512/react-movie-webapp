### Hello! 
This is my learning of React via a Functional Programming Approach. I took referrence from the following tutorials:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ0bZGfg_m4


### Accomplished Features: 
1. a grid of movies 
2. the movie detail page for every movie 
3. the display of the detail page by clicking the movie
4. the return to main page from detail page
5. filter movies by genre
6. filter movies by year 

### Chanllenges to be addressed: 
1. Interactions/behaviours between filter by movies and filter by genre
2. Attempted to call API multiple times, however, the server may not respond well to frequent request and run into Error 500.
3. Attempted to dynamically generate the filter buttons in Filter.js, while manipulating the content on the App.js. However, this leads to the error of "Cannot update a component (`App`) while rendering a different component (`Filter`)." 

### Features to be implemented 
1. Dynamic generation of filter buttons
2. Searching using both year and genre at the same time
3. A search function 

### Areas to  be improved: 
1. The understanding of react hooks such as useState() and useEffect(). 
2. The dynamic flow and interactions among different elements generated by react. 

### Running Instruction: 
Ensure that you have Node.js installed, updated. 
Enter the directory via CMD (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), run: 

### `npm start`

Then, open your browser at http://localhost:3000/

### Thank you for your kind support!
