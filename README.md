### Accomplished Features: 
1. a grid of movies 
2. the movie detail page for every movie 
3. the display of the detail page 
4. the return to main page from detail page
5. filter movies by genre

### Chanllenges Faced: 
1. Attempted to complete filter by year, but this leads to the movies (array of movie objects to become empty), leading  to  type error. 
2. Attempted to use API multipl times, however, the server may not respond well to frequent request and run into Error 500.
3. Attempted to dynamically generate the filter buttons in Filter.js, while manipulating the content on the App.js. However, this leads to the error of "Cannot update a component (`App`) while rendering a different component (`Filter`)." 

### Running Instruction:

Enter the directory via CMD (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), run:
